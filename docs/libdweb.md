# Notes on Developing with `libdweb`

> [`mozilla/libdweb`](https://github.com/mozilla/libdweb) hosts a community
effort to implement experimental APIs for Firefox WebExtensions with a goal of
enabling dweb protocols in Firefox through browser add-ons. The long term goal
of this project is to integrate these APIs into the WebExtensions ecosystem.

## TL;DR

1. Execute commands below to fetch Firefox Nightly, build and run Companion extension in libdweb-enabled context:
   ```
   git clone -b libdweb --depth 1 https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion.git
   cd ipfs-companion
   npm run libdweb
   ```

2. Optional Smoke-Test:
   - Open `ipfs://bafkreickb4yq3sr3q2xqn3z3wzimilsa4wkbx25azqbvcnihq65moyjcvi`
   - Open `ipns://docs.ipfs.io`
   - Open `ipns://tr.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org`
   - Confirm `ipfs://` protocol remains in Location Bar ([example](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeie5gq4jxvzmsym6hjlwxej4rwdoxt7wadqvmmwbqi7r27fclha2va))

## Developer Notes


### Install Firefox Nightly

- Get latest Nightly from http://nightly.mozilla.org/
   - libdweb won't run in regular release, it has to be nightly or developer edition

### How to Build and run libdweb-enabled bundle

```
# checkout libdweb branch into a new directory
# including submodules (namely ./libdweb)
git clone -b libdweb --depth 1 https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion.git
cd ipfs-companion

# install deps and build
npm run libdweb:build

# run in firefox-nightly (linux only)
npm run libdweb:firefox
```

### Manually run with different firefox binary (or on macOS)

To run your extension in libdweb context:

```
npm run libdweb:build
export MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX=1
npx web-ext run --firefox="/Applications/Firefox Nightly.app" --browser-console --url about:debugging
```

Additional notes:

- Script `libdweb:firefox` will download latest Firefox Nightly to `./firefox/firefox`
- After initially running `libdweb:build` it is ok to use `yarn watch` – it will work as expected

## Known Issues

If you are using `yarn` it may not update github-based dependencies and produce bogus `this.content is undefined` errors.

Fix is to make sure you run the latest versions of `libdweb` and other dev deps by removing yarn cache.
Execute `yarn cache clean`.

## Appendix: Smoke-Testing libdweb APIs

#### Protocol Handler API

1. Open `ipfs://bafkreickb4yq3sr3q2xqn3z3wzimilsa4wkbx25azqbvcnihq65moyjcvi`
1. Open `ipns://docs.ipfs.io`
1. Confirm `ipfs://` protocol remains in Location Bar ([example](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeie5gq4jxvzmsym6hjlwxej4rwdoxt7wadqvmmwbqi7r27fclha2va))
