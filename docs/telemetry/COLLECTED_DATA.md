## What metrics data DO we collect

As a general rule, we collect only application data; no user data. Some examples of application data we collect are:

| view:browser-action | views               | When the browser-action view is shown                   | View count                                                        |               |
| event:url-resolved  | event               | Number of URLs resolved by companion                    | Metrics                                                           |               |

* "Metric data name" - The app-specific metric/event name we're using for this metric data. (e.g. APP_BOOTSTRAP_START)
* "Metric feature name" - The metric feature the event/metric data correlates to. The group the metric feature belongs to is defined in our [COLLECTION_POLICY](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ignite-metrics/blob/main/docs/telemetry/COLLECTION_POLICY.md#metric-features-and-their-groupings). (e.g. Minimal)
* "Metric trigger" - An explanation covering when this metric data is triggered. (e.g. On Application init)
* "Analytics use" - An explanation about how this metric data is used for analytics. (e.g. Input to load time calculations)
* "Notes" - Any additional notes. (e.g. Used as a timestamp identifier for when an application is first loaded)
