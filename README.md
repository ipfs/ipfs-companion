## Background

This add-on enables everyone to access IPFS resources the way they were meant: from locally running IPFS node :-)

IPFS is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities.
IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications.
It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

Learn more at [ipfs.io](https://ipfs.io) (it is really cool, we promise!)

## Features

#### Automagical Detection of IPFS Resources

  Requests for IPFS-like paths (`/ipfs/$cid` or `/ipns/$peerid_or_fqdn-with-dnslink`) are detected on any website.  
  If tested path is a valid IPFS address it gets redirected and loaded from a local gateway, e.g:  
  `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbWqxBEKC3P8tqsKc98xmWNzrzDtRLMiMPL8wBuTGsMnR`  
  â†’ `http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/QmbWqxBEKC3P8tqsKc98xmWNzrzDtRLMiMPL8wBuTGsMnR`

#### IPFS API as `window.ipfs`

Your IPFS node is exposed as `window.ipfs` on every webpage.
Websites can detect if `window.ipfs` exists and opt-in to use it instead of creating their own `js-ipfs` node.
It saves system resources and battery (on mobile), avoids the overhead of peer discovery/connection, enables shared repository access and more!
Make sure to read our [notes on `window.ipfs`](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/blob/master/docs/window.ipfs.md), where we explain it in-depth and provide examples on how to use it your own dapp.

#### Toggle Between Embedded and External Node

> ![screenshot of node type toggle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/157609/39421672-59010924-4c6a-11e8-9e64-6b5d5f5f2768.png)

The Browser Action menu provides a toggle for switching  between embedded,
in-memory `js-ipfs` and external IPFS node accessed over HTTP API.
Read about differences at [docs/node-types](docs/node-types.md).

#### IPFS Status and Context Actions

- IPFS API and Gateway status
- Quick Upload of local files
- Easy access to [WebUI](https://github.com/ipfs/webui/) and add-on Preferences
- Toggle redirection to local gateway (automatic by default, manual mode can be enabled in Preferences)
- Additional actions for pages loaded from IPFS
    - Pin/Unpin of IPFS resources (via API)
    - Copy canonical IPFS address
    - Copy shareable URL to resource at preferred public gateway

#### Experiments!

_(some are disabled by default, use Preferences screen to enable)_

- Requests made via [experimental protocols](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion/issues/164) are re-routed to HTTP gateway (public or custom):
    - `ipns://$cid`
    - `ipns://$cid_or_fqdn`
    - `dweb:/ipfs/$cid`
    - `dweb:/ipns/$cid_or_fqdn`
- Detect domains with [dnslink](https://github.com/jbenet/go-dnslink) in DNS TXT record and load them from IPFS
- Make plaintext IPFS links clickable
- Mirror to IPFS by right click on any image or video
- Embedded node can be used for uploads even when external API is down

## Install

### Release Channel

We recommend installing the stable release via your browser's add-on store.

| Firefox                                                                                                                                                    | Chrome / Chromium                                                                                                                                                                              |

| [![Install From AMO](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSX44XockQifmxE8Wdevkaa6vaqTXtGdH9t9aHWXZkuJq)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ipfs-companion/) | [![Install from Chrome Store](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPinSJKFYCMuTDh484dLk5Av4HpZRzBRR1KPv7TM7CBVF)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipfs-companion/nibjojkomfdiaoajekhjakgkdhaomnch) |

**Note:** `ipfs-companion` is designed to retrieve content from a locally running IPFS daemon.  
Make sure [IPFS is installed](https://ipfs.io/docs/getting-started/) on your computer.

### Beta Channel

Developers and enthusiasts can opt-in for Beta-quality channel with hand-picked Dev Builds:

- Beta for Firefox: [Self-hosted Signed Dev Build](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR8W5wg8BuAyBTruHnHovfWRavwvidVh3qtyinXi6NnLa)
- Beta for Chrome: [Dev Build at Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipfs-companion-dev-build/hjoieblefckbooibpepigmacodalfndh)

It is also possible to [grab the last successful build from `master`](https://ci.ipfs.team/job/IPFS%20Shipyard/job/ipfs-companion/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/),
but these builds are not signed nor will automatically update:
`.zip` bundles are meant only to be manually loaded via `chrome://extensions` (Chrome) or `about:debugging` (Firefox) for the purpose of quick smoke-testing.

## Development

To work on the extension you need to install it from source rather than from the add on store.

1. Clone https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion.git
2. Build it:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build    
    npm run bundle:generic # for Chrome dev
    # or
    npm run bundle:firefox # for Firefox dev (build default)
    ```

3. Load it into browser:
    * Chromium-based
        1. Enter `chrome://extensions` in the URL bar
        2. Enable "Developer mode"
        3. Click "Load unpacked extension..."
        4. Pick the _directory_ `add-on`

    * Firefox
        1. Enter `about:debugging` in the URL bar
        2. Check "Enable add-on debugging"
        3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
        4. Pick the _file_ `add-on/manifest.json`

**See [`docs/developer-notes.md`](docs/developer-notes.md) for more detailed instructions**

### Reproducible Build in Docker

Want to ensure prebuilt bundle does not include any additional code?  
Don't want to install JS dependencies such as NodeJS and yarn?  

Do an isolated build inside of Docker!

Run the following command for ending up
with a built extension inside the `build/` directory:

```sh
npm run release-build
```

It is an alias for running `ci:build` script inside of immutable Docker image, which guarantees the same output on all platforms.

### Legacy Firefox (< 53) and XUL-Compatible Browsers

Legacy  versions `1.x.x` were based on currently deprecated Add-On SDK (Firefox-only).   
While it is not maintained anymore, one can inspect, build and install it using codebase from [legacy-sdk](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion/tree/legacy-sdk) branch.    
For historical background on the rewrite see [Issue #20: Move to WebExtensions](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion/issues/20).

We are also available at the [#ipfs](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs) channel, where most of IPFS community hangs out.

#### Upload via Right-Click Does Not Work in Firefox

See [this workaround](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion/issues/227).

#### Workaround for HTTP Redirect to Work with Ghostery

[Ghostery](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/) is known to toy with HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect, which in some setups breaks websites utilizing public gateways. More details in [#466](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/466). Until it is fixed upstream, a workaround is to [whitelist](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/157609/39089525-5834c104-45c9-11e8-9e17-4459a97e5676.png) affected site. 

#### Rule to Work with NoScript with ABE Enabled

By default [NoScript](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/) breaks this addon by blocking assets loaded from IPFS Gateway running on localhost.    
To make it work, one needs to extend the SYSTEM Rulset and prepend it with IPFS whitelist:

```
# Enable IPFS redirect to LOCAL
Site ^http://127.0.0.1:8080/(ipfs|ipns)*
Anonymize

# Prevent Internet sites from requesting LAN resources.
Site LOCAL
Accept from LOCAL
Deny
```

Feel free to modify it, but get familiar with [ABE rule syntax](https://noscript.net/abe/abe_rules.pdf) first.
